# ðŸ¦€ CrustNote

CrustNote is a simple **task/notes REST API** built with [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Itâ€™s designed as a learning project to practice **ownership, lifetimes, and JSON serialization** while building real-world APIs.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Create new tasks (with `POST /tasks`)
- List all tasks (with `GET /tasks`)
- Fetch a task by ID (with `GET /tasks/:id`)
- Delete a task (with `DELETE /tasks/:id`)
- UUID-based task IDs
- JSON request/response (powered by Serde)
